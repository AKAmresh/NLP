    "**Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the tweets file using read_csv function from Pandas package.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Get the tweets into a list for easy text cleanup and manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To cleanup:\n",
    "    1. Normalize the casing.\n",
    "    2. Using regular expressions, remove user handles. These begin with '@’.\n",
    "    3. Using regular expressions, remove URLs.\n",
    "    4. Using TweetTokenizer from NLTK, tokenize the tweets into individual terms.\n",
    "    5. Remove stop words.\n",
    "    6. Remove redundant terms like ‘amp’, ‘rt’, etc.\n",
    "    7. Remove ‘#’ symbols from the tweet while retaining the term.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Extra cleanup by removing terms with a length of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Check out the top terms in the tweets:\n",
    "    1. First, get all the tokenized terms into one large list.\n",
    "    2. Use the counter and find the 10 most common terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Data formatting for predictive modeling:\n",
    "    1. Join the tokens back to form strings. This will be required for the vectorizers.\n",
    "    2. Assign x and y.\n",
    "    3. Perform train_test_split using sklearn.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. We’ll use TF-IDF values for the terms as a feature to get into a vector space model.\n",
    "    1. Import TF-IDF  vectorizer from sklearn.\n",
    "    2. Instantiate with a maximum of 5000 terms in your vocabulary.\n",
    "    3. Fit and apply on the train set.\n",
    "    4. Apply on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Model building: Ordinary Logistic Regression\n",
    "    1. Instantiate Logistic Regression from sklearn with default parameters.\n",
    "    2. Fit into  the train data.\n",
    "    3. Make predictions for the train and the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Model evaluation: Accuracy, recall, and f_1 score.\n",
    "    1. Report the accuracy on the train set.\n",
    "    2. Report the recall on the train set: decent, high, or low.\n",
    "    3. Get the f1 score on the train set.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Looks like you need to adjust the class imbalance, as the model seems to focus on the 0s.\n",
    "    1. Adjust the appropriate class in the LogisticRegression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Train again with the adjustment and evaluate.\n",
    "    1. Train the model on the train set.\n",
    "    2. Evaluate the predictions on the train set: accuracy, recall, and f_1 score.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Regularization and Hyperparameter tuning:\n",
    "    1. Import GridSearch and StratifiedKFold because of class imbalance.\n",
    "    2. Provide the parameter grid to choose for ‘C’ and ‘penalty’ parameters.\n",
    "    3. Use a balanced class weight while instantiating the logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Find the parameters with the best recall in cross-validation.\n",
    "    1. Choose ‘recall’ as the metric for scoring.\n",
    "    2. Choose a stratified 4 fold cross-validation scheme.\n",
    "    3. Fit into  the train set.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What are the best parameters?\n",
    "\n",
    "15. Predict and evaluate using the best estimator.\n",
    "    1. Use the best estimator from the grid search to make predictions on the test set.\n",
    "    2. What is the recall on the test set for the toxic comments?\n",
    "    3. What is the f_1 score?"
